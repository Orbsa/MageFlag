This reads your clipboard and converts it to an a binary blob that will store it to your registry
Essentially you just need to run this sketchy .exe you can grab from releases and it while it stays running, any image you put in your clipboard will be shoved into the flag you save in the game

Transparent images will have a black background so just put it in paint first if you want a different color
